The division can now serve and accommodate better its clientele as there will be a wider and comfortable space in the area.</p>\n<p>Rev. Rodele P. Diego of the Four Square Gospel Church shared the word of God and dedicated the building by anointing each office with the oil coming from the Holy Land. Rev. Diego emphasized that the building was a blessing from God and we have to thank Him for it and may it will be used for His glory.</p>\n<p>Mayor Aniano P. Antalan congratulated DepEd for the completion of its building and hope that this will help in achieving its vision and mission of giving quality education to the children of IGaCoS. He further committed to allocate Php 1.5 million for the electrification and water installation of the new building.</p>\n<p>Former Superintendent Juan E. Taloma, the first Division Superintendent graced the occasion and was amazed by the growth of the Division which he started from ground zero.</p>\n<p>Superintendent Eufemia Gamutin, CESO VI expressed her warmest and heartfelt thanks to the local government, DepEd central and regional office, division personnel, school heads and its stakeholders for collaboratively working for the success of the activity and for the fulfilment of the dream of having an office.</p>\n<p>The affair was graced by Hon. Richard Guindolman, Chair of the Education Committee, City Administrator Guillermo Olden, City Budget Officer Jemelita Camaso, City Treasurer Merlina Caballero, City Agriculturist Anna Lea Zapanta, Pastor Edgar Sola, the school heads of the elementary and secondary schools, division personnel and DepEd IGaCoS valued stakeholders.
